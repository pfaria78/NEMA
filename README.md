This app is just really for taekwondo class, maybe one day it will evolve into something more.
```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
